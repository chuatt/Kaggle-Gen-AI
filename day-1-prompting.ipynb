    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",
    "* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

       "    * **Themes:**  Change the color scheme of your prompt based on pre-defined themes (Default, Custom) or even create your own theme.\n",
       "    * **Symbols:** Customize the symbols used for different status indicators (e.g., ahead, behind, untracked files).\n",
       "    * **Virtual Environment:** Display your active Python virtual environment or Node.js virtual environment (if enabled).\n",
       "    * **Username and Repo:** Optionally display the username and repository name.\n",
       "* **Configuration:** The script provides settings to control how the Git information is presented, allowing you to customize:\n",
       "    * **Display Behavior:**  Control when the Git information is displayed (only in Git repositories, always, or never).\n",
       "    * **Status Retrieval:** Choose whether to fetch remote information and how often to check for updates.\n",

       "\n",
       "**Why you'd use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Enhanced Awareness:**  The script provides you with a more informed command line experience. You can quickly glance at your prompt to see:\n",
       "    * The current Git branch you're working on.\n",
       "    * If you have uncommitted changes.\n",

       "**How to use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Download:** Download the script.\n",
       "2. **Place:** Put it in a directory within your shell's PATH environment variable (e.g., ~/.local/bin).\n",
